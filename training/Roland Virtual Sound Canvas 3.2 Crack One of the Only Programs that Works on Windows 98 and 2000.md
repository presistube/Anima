If you are still interested in Roland Virtual Sound Canvas 3.2, you might be wondering how it compares to the original hardware module that it emulates: the Roland Sound Canvas SC-88 Pro. The SC-88 Pro was released in 1996 as an upgraded version of the SC-88, which was itself a successor of the SC-55, the first General MIDI sound module. The SC-88 Pro offered a huge sound set of 1117 instruments and 42 drum kits, many of them derived from Roland's JD- and JV-series synth expansion boards. It also had 64-note polyphony, 32-part multitimbrality, three effects processors, two-band EQ, and a PC/Mac interface. The SC-88 Pro was widely used by professional musicians, composers, and game developers for its high-quality sounds and versatile features.
 
Roland Virtual Sound Canvas 3.2 is a software version of the SC-88 Pro that runs on Windows and Mac computers. It replicates the sound and functionality of the hardware module, with some minor differences and limitations. For example, it does not support MIDI input and output, so you cannot use it as a MIDI device for other programs. It also does not have a stereo audio input, so you cannot process external audio signals with its effects. However, it does have some advantages over the hardware module, such as being cheaper, more portable, and easier to integrate with your DAW software.
 
So which one should you choose: Roland Virtual Sound Canvas 3.2 or Roland Sound Canvas SC-88 Pro? The answer depends on your needs and preferences. If you want a faithful emulation of the classic sound module that works well with your computer-based music production setup, then Roland Virtual Sound Canvas 3.2 might be a good option for you. However, if you prefer to have a physical device that can be connected to other MIDI gear and external audio sources, then Roland Sound Canvas SC-88 Pro might be a better choice for you. Either way, you will get access to a rich and diverse collection of sounds that can enhance your musical creativity.
