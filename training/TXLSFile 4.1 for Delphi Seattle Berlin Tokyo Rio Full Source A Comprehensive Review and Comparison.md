## How to create a new Excel file with TXLSFile 4.1
 
Creating a new Excel file with TXLSFile 4.1 is very simple. You just need to create an instance of the TXLSFile class and call the Save method with the file name as a parameter. For example:

    uses
      XLSFile;
    
    var
      xls: TXLSFile;
    begin
      xls := TXLSFile.Create;
      try
        // add some data and formatting here
        xls.Save('test.xlsx');
      finally
        xls.Free;
      end;
    end;

This code will create a new Excel file named test.xlsx in the same folder as your executable. You can also specify a different path or use a stream instead of a file name.
 
TXLSFile supports both XLS and XLSX formats. You can choose the format by setting the FileFormat property of the TXLSFile object. The default value is xlExcel12, which corresponds to XLSX. You can also use xlExcel8 for XLS or xlAuto for automatic detection based on the file extension.
