## What is Sculptris?
 
Sculptris is a 3D sculpting software developed by Pixologic, the same company that created ZBrush, a more advanced and professional sculpting tool. Sculptris is designed to be simple and intuitive, so anyone can pick it up and start sculpting without any prior experience. Sculptris uses a dynamic tessellation system that automatically adds more polygons to your model as you sculpt, giving you more detail and flexibility. You can also paint your model with different materials and colors, and export it as an OBJ or STL file for further editing or 3D printing.

## How to Use Sculptris: The Interface
 
When you open Sculptris, you will see a simple and minimalist interface with your model in the center of the window. On the left-hand side, you will see a toolbar with different sculpting brushes that you can use to manipulate your model. On the top, you will see a properties panel that lets you adjust the size, strength, and other options of the selected brush. On the right-hand side, you will see a quick access toolbar that lets you switch between sculpting and painting modes, enable symmetry, undo and redo actions, and access other tools.
 
To navigate around your model, you can use the following controls:
 
- Hold right mouse button: Orbit the object.
- Hold ALT and right mouse button: Move object up, down, left, right.
- Scroll mouse wheel: Zoom in and out.
- Hold CTRL and right mouse button: Zoom in and out.

To sculpt your model, you can use the following controls:

- Hold left mouse button: Sculpt with the selected brush.
- Hold CTRL and left mouse button: Sculpt with the inverted brush.
- Hold SHIFT and left mouse button: Smooth the surface of the model.
- Hold spacebar: Access quick brush controls.

## How to Use Sculptris: The Brushes
 
Sculptris has several brushes that you can use to sculpt your model. Each brush has a different effect on the surface of the model. Here are some of the most common brushes and what they do:

- Draw: This brush builds up clay in a smooth manner. You can use it to add volume and shape to your model. You can also enable clay or soft options in the properties panel for different effects.
- Inflate: This brush inflates the area by giving volume to areas on the model. You can use it to create overhangs on edges, such as ears, nostrils, or lips.
- Crease: This brush cuts into the clay leaving an indentation. You can use it to create wrinkles or to sharply define part of the model. You can also invert this brush to create a sharp ridge instead.
- Flatten: This brush creates a flat edge to part of the model. You can use it to polish and finesse the shapes on your model. You can also enable lock plane or angle falloff options in the properties panel for different effects.
