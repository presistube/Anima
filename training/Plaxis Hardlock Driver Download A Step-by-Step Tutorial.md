## Troubleshoot Plaxis Hardlock Driver Issues
 
Sometimes, you may encounter some issues when using Plaxis with your HWL. For example, you may get an error message saying that your drivers are out of date or that your HWL is not detected. Here are some possible solutions for these issues:

- Update your drivers: If you get an error message saying that your drivers are out of date, you may need to update them to the latest version. You can do this by downloading and installing the latest version of the Plaxis Hardlock Driver from the Bentley Software Downloads page[^1^].
- Restart your computer: If you get an error message saying that your HWL is not detected, you may need to restart your computer and reconnect your HWL. This may help resolve any driver conflicts or communication issues between your computer and your HWL.
- Stop any processes related to CodeMeter or Hardlock: If you still get an error message after updating your drivers and restarting your computer, you may need to stop any processes related to CodeMeter or Hardlock on your computer. You can do this by opening Task Manager and ending any processes named "codemeter.exe" or "codemetercc.exe". This may help clear any cached data or settings that may interfere with your HWL.
- Contact Bentley support: If none of the above solutions work, you may need to contact Bentley support for further assistance. You can submit a service request on their website[^2^] or call their phone number (+ 8cf37b1e13
