## Tips and Tricks to Win Ludo Supremo
 
Ludo Supremo is a game of luck and strategy. Here are some tips and tricks to help you win the game and become the Ludo Supremo:

- Roll the dice wisely. You can roll the dice up to three times in a turn, but you have to move one of your tokens according to the last roll. Try to roll a six as often as possible, as it gives you an extra turn and allows you to enter or exit your home.
- Move your tokens strategically. You can move your tokens in any direction on the board, but you have to follow some rules. You cannot move your token to a square that is already occupied by another token of the same color. You can capture an opponent's token by landing on its square, which sends it back to its base. You can also form a block by placing two tokens of the same color on adjacent squares, which prevents other tokens from passing through.
- Protect your tokens from being captured. You can do this by moving them closer to your home or forming blocks with them. You can also use special squares such as stars and circles, which are safe zones where no token can be captured.
- Race to your home before others. To win the game, you have to move all four of your tokens to your home before anyone else does. Your home is located at the center of the board and has four squares of your color. You have to enter your home from the square that matches your color and move clockwise until you reach the final square.
