# INTJ: The Mastermind Personality Type
 
INTJ is one of the 16 personality types based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular psychometric tool that classifies people into four main cognitive functions: Introversion (I), Intuition (N), Thinking (T), and Judging (J). INTJs are known for their strategic thinking, analytical skills, and independent nature. They are often seen as visionary leaders, innovative thinkers, and intellectual problem-solvers.

Their tertiary function is Introverted Feeling (Fi), which means they have a deep sense of personal values and ethics that guide their decisions. They are loyal, principled, and authentic, and they respect individuality and diversity.
