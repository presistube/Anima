## The Story Behind Sweet Child O' Mine
 
Sweet Child O' Mine was written by Guns N' Roses members Axl Rose, Slash, Izzy Stradlin, Duff McKagan, and Steven Adler. The song was inspired by Rose's then-girlfriend Erin Everly, who was the daughter of Don Everly of the Everly Brothers. Rose wrote the lyrics as a poem for her, while Slash came up with the guitar riff as a joke during a jam session.
 
The song was recorded in 1987 at Rumbo Studios in Canoga Park, California. It was produced by Mike Clink, who had previously worked with bands like Metallica and Megadeth. The song was initially rejected by the band's label Geffen Records, who thought it was too soft and not suitable for a hard rock band. However, after hearing positive feedback from radio stations and fans, the label decided to release it as a single.
