In this article, we will show you how to download and restore the GTA 4 PC backup files in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Find out which files you need
 
The first step is to find out which files you need to download and restore. GTA 4 PC has several files that are essential for the game to run properly, such as .rpf files, .img files, .xex file, etc. Depending on what you have modded or deleted, you might need different files.
 
For example, if you have modded the vehicles or weapons in the game, you might need to download and restore the vehicles.img and weapons.img files. If you have modded the game's graphics or effects, you might need to download and restore the common.rpf and xbox360.rpf files. If you have modded the game's script or missions, you might need to download and restore the script.img and script\_network.img files.
 
To find out which files you need, you can either check the readme file of the mod you have installed, or compare your game folder with a clean installation of GTA 4 PC. You can also use a tool like GTA IV Recoverer[^4^] to scan your game folder and identify which files are missing or modified.
 
## Step 2: Download the backup files
 
The next step is to download the backup files that you need. There are several websites that offer GTA 4 PC backup files for free download, such as libertycity.net[^1^], se7ensins.com[^2^], gta-downloads.com[^3^], etc. You can also find some backup files on YouTube videos[^3^] or other forums.
 
When downloading the backup files, make sure they are compatible with your game version and region. For example, if you have GTA 4 PC version 1.0.7.0 for North America, you should download the backup files for that version and region. Also, make sure the backup files are not infected with viruses or malware.

## Step 3: Restore the backup files

Before restoring the backup files, it is recommended that you make a backup copy of your current game folder, in case something goes wrong or you want to revert back to your modded game later. You can also use a tool like GTA IV Recoverer[^4^] to backup and restore your game files easily.
 
After restoring the backup files, you should be able to launch and play GTA 4 PC without any issues or errors. If you still encounter any problems, you might need to reinstall the game completely or contact Rockstar Games support for assistance.
