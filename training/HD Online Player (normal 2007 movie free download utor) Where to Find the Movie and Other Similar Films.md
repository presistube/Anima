Normal is a 2007 Canadian drama movie directed by Carl Bessai and starring Carrie-Anne Moss, Kevin Zegers, Callum Keith Rennie, and Andrew Airlie. The movie follows the lives of four people who are connected by a tragic car accident that killed a young boy. The boy's mother (Moss) struggles to cope with her loss and neglects her surviving son; the boy's girlfriend (Lauren Lee Smith) befriends the driver (Zegers) who was released from juvenile detention; the driver's stepmother (Camille Sullivan) tries to bond with him; and the boy's uncle (Rennie), a college teacher with an autistic brother (Tygh Runyan), develops an attraction to one of his students.
 
The movie explores the themes of grief, guilt, forgiveness, and healing in a realistic and emotional way. The characters are complex and flawed, but also sympathetic and relatable. The movie does not offer easy answers or solutions, but rather shows how each person deals with their pain and tries to find some normalcy in their lives. The movie also features excellent performances from the cast, especially Moss and Zegers, who convey their characters' inner turmoil with subtlety and intensity.
