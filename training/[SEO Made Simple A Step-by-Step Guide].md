### Scenario 1: Use a Proxy Server to Route All Computer Traffic
 
This scenario will configure Proxifier to send all your traffic through a proxy server. This means that every application on your Mac will use the proxy server to connect to the internet. This can help you hide your real IP address, access geo-restricted websites, or bypass network firewalls.
 
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Proxifier and click on the Proxy Servers icon in the toolbar.
2. Click on the Add button to add a new proxy server.
3. Enter the IP address and port number of your proxy server in the Address field. For example: 192.168.1.1:8080
4. Select the protocol of your proxy server from the Protocol drop-down menu. For example: SOCKS5
5. If your proxy server requires authentication, check the Enable box under Authentication and enter your username and password in the fields below. You can also select NTLM or Kerberos if your proxy server supports them.
6. Click OK to save your proxy server settings.
7. Click on the Proxification Rules icon in the toolbar.
8. Select Default from the list of rules and click on Edit.
9. Select your proxy server from the Action drop-down menu and click OK.
10. Click OK again to apply your proxification rules.

Now Proxifier will route all your computer traffic through your proxy server. You can verify this by visiting [this website](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) and checking your IP address. It should show the IP address of your proxy server instead of your real one.
